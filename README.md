# Causal_StructuralLearn-DAGs

>If you have already gained sufficient familiarity with the renowned Potential Outcomes framework proposed by Rubin, we invite you to explore causality from another perspective. Our study program focuses on investigating causal relationships through the Directed Acyclic Graphs (DAGs) framework.

DAGs offer a fresh and insightful approach to understanding causation, and we are thrilled to embark on this journey with fellow curious minds like yours. As part of the program, we will delve into a new survey article that comprehensively examines the application and implications of DAGs in causal inference.
